## Welcome to Game 2048!
The goal of the game is to get a cell with a value of 2048 by combining the same numbered cells.

## How to Play
The game takes place on a 4x4 board, on which new cells with a value of 2 or 4 appear on each turn. You can make moves by moving all the cells on the board in one of four directions (up, down, left or right). If two cells with the same values collide during such a move, they will merge into one, with the sum of their values.

The game ends when you reach the goal (value 2048) or can make no more moves.
